# NaturalMind

Over the years of evolution, our brains have been optimized to be able to quickly identify patterns and use input information in the best way to learn. Now, if we can simulate the structure of the brain in a way on a computer, then we will be able to develop more advanced learning algorithms. This would have a tremendous impact on how intelligent machines are developed , and how we as humans interact with them. If it is possible to do so, then it will be possible to have an intelligent machine that is able to learn without any kind of human input .In this project, I tried to implement the structure of neurons and how they relate to others in the simplest possible way, using the latest findings in neuroscience. In order to create the structure of the neurons I decided to use multiprocessing on each unit .
