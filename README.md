Over the years of evolution, our brains have been optimized to be able to quickly identify patterns and use input information in the best way to learn. Now, if we can simulate the structure of the brain in a way on a computer, then we will be able to develop more advanced learning algorithms. This would have a tremendous impact on how intelligent machines are developed , and how we as humans interact with them.
