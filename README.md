# Bio-Inspired Human Neuron Modeling with Multiprocessing

This project demonstrates a technique for replicating human brain neurons and their connections, leveraging recent advancements in neuroscience. I utilized multiprocessing to efficiently construct a neuron network that closely resembles human pyramidal neurons, capable of integrating, processing, and storing information. Our method offers potential applications in various medical domains, including the study of memory-related pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder.
